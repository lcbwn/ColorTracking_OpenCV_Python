# ColorTracking | using OpenCV && Python
A program that aims to: 
  - Get web cam video stream
  - Extact an HSV color range
  - Detect the contours and hierarchy
  - Track the biggest contour as long as we change the HSV color ranges by drawing a red cercle whose center is on the centroid of the contour.
